        Week 2 - <div id="piece_title">Ulises Carrión - Mail Art and the Big Monster from Second Thoughts</div>
      </div>
      <div id="description">
        Ulises Carrión’s Mail Art and the Big Monster redefines Mail Art as an artistic act rather than a celebration of the postal system. His distinction between mail as a support rather than a medium resonated with me, especially in how art often transcends its method of delivery. The debate over what qualifies as Mail Art is interesting. Does repetition define it, or does intent? Carrión argues for mass distribution, but I think a singular, intentional piece could still be art if it transforms communication. The Big Monster metaphor stood out as a critique of bureaucracy, conformity, or even existential dread. Mail Art, in this view, is a form of resistance against rigid systems, stagnation, and isolation. His final call for more ideas makes me wonder how Mail Art could evolve today, especially in digital spaces where messages travel instantly but often lack personal, tangible meaning.

        Week 3 - <div id="piece_title">Laurel Schwulst & Édouard U - Selections from Creative Independent and Arena How Do You Use the Internet Mindfully</div>
      </div>
      <div id="description">
        Laurel Schwulst’s perspective on personal websites resonated with me, especially her emphasis on intention and metaphor. The idea that a website is not just a static portfolio but a living, evolving space is refreshing. It makes me question what a personal website should be. Should it act as a structured room, a growing plant, or a fleeting puddle? This redefinition moves away from corporate expectations and toward something more personal and experimental. Édouard U.’s nonlinear approach to knowledge was interesting, though I find comfort in following a single narrative rather than bouncing between sources. However, his idea that meaning is best formed through interconnection rather than isolation makes me reconsider how I engage with information. The internet offers endless ways to link ideas, yet we often fall into linear consumption patterns.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Questions:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>How do different metaphors for websites shape user interaction?</li>
          <li>How can personal knowledge networks enhance creativity without becoming overwhelming?</li>

      </div>
      <div id="description">
        Olia Lialina’s Still There: Ruins and Templates of Geocities presents a fascinating look at digital decay and the preservation of early web culture. Reading about the efforts to archive Geocities made me reflect on how much of the internet we take for granted as permanent, even though entire digital communities can vanish overnight. The idea that Geocities was unfairly dismissed as “amateur” resonates, especially since its users were a diverse mix of people shaping online expression in their own ways. I found the comparison between Geocities and modern corporate-controlled platforms particularly compelling. While today’s web prioritizes sleek, user-friendly interfaces, it sacrifices the personal, chaotic, and expressive nature that defined early internet spaces. The discussion of broken links, missing images, and abandoned pages as digital ruins also stood out. It makes me wonder how we define digital permanence and what role nostalgia plays in preserving online history.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Questions:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>How does nostalgia influence the way we view past internet spaces?</li>
          <li>What lessons can modern web designers take from Geocities’ creativity?</li>

        Week 5 - <div id="piece_title">Alessandro Ludovico & Florian Cramer - Selections from Publishing from Post-Digital-Print</div>
      </div>
      <div id="description">
        Alessandro Ludovico and Florian Cramer’s Post-Digital Print raises compelling points about the evolving relationship between print and digital media. The idea that print will shift toward being a collectible or a luxury object is interesting, but I don’t think it has fully materialized yet. Many people, including myself, still prefer physical books for their tactility, lack of blue light, and embodied reading experience. Unlike music, where vinyl has become a nostalgic collector’s item despite being technically inferior, print retains practical advantages over digital formats. What stood out to me was the discussion of how digital media thrives on networking rather than just format changes. The ability to link, update, and customize digital content is its true strength, whereas print remains static. This contrast makes me wonder whether future innovations will blend both mediums rather than phase out print entirely.        <br><br>
        <strong>Questions:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>What role does nostalgia play in keeping print relevant?</li>
          <li>Could networked print, like on-demand or personalized books, create a new hybrid publishing model?</li>

        Week 7 - <div id="piece_title">Bojana Coklyat & Shannon Finnegan - Selections from Alt-Text as Poetry Workbook</div>
      </div>
      <div id="description">
        Bojana Coklyat and Shannon Finnegan’s Alt-Text as Poetry Workbook reframes alt text as an artistic and thoughtful practice rather than a mere accessibility requirement. I found it interesting how they explore the balance between objectivity and subjectivity in alt text. Since descriptions inherently carry bias, writing alt text becomes an interpretive act, shaped by the describer’s choices. The reading made me reconsider how I engage with images online and the effort required to make visual media more accessible. The metaphor of alt text as poetry was especially compelling. Thinking about it in terms of conciseness, creativity, and intent adds depth to an often-overlooked practice. However, the idea that artists should describe their own work is complicated. While it allows for personal expression, it also raises concerns about bias and accessibility expertise.        <br><br>
        <strong>Questions:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>How can we make alt text more common without making it feel like a chore?</li>
          <li>How does the shift toward AI-generated descriptions affect accessibility and artistic intent?</li>

      </div>
      <div id="description">
        Ramsey Nasser’s A Personal Computer for Children of All Cultures raises essential questions about the Anglocentric nature of programming. The idea that English dominance in coding is not just a technical limitation but a cultural imposition stood out to me. Programming’s reliance on English-based syntax and identifiers makes it difficult for non-English speakers to fully engage with software development on their own terms, reinforcing global linguistic hierarchies. The challenges Nasser faced when developing his Arabic-based programming language highlight how deeply embedded English is in computing. Even when designing a non-English programming language, technical infrastructure like GitHub and text editors defaulted to English. This makes me wonder if a truly multilingual programming environment is possible or if English will remain the default indefinitely.        <br><br>
        <strong>Questions:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>How can we design programming languages that are more accessible to non-English speakers without isolating them?</li>
          <li>Could a multilingual aliasing system help bridge the gap between different linguistic communities in coding?</li>

        Week 10 - <div id="piece_title">David Reinfurt - Selections from A *New* Program for Graphic Design</div>
      </div>
      <div id="description">
        David Reinfurt’s A New Program for Graphic Design made me think more about how perception shapes our experience of visuals. I was familiar with the idea that “the whole is greater than the sum of its parts,” but Reinfurt’s deeper explanation helped me see how our minds actively build meaning from what we see. The moving light example really stuck with me, I would’ve seen it as one dot too. It shows how easily our brains fill in gaps and create stories from simple visuals. This matters a lot in design, where how something feels can impact how people use or respond to it.        <br><br>
        <strong>Questions:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Are there times when a clear design and a creative one conflict?</li>
          <li>How much should personal interpretation shape the design process?</li>

        Week 12 - <div id="piece_title">Dot Tuer - Beyond the New Media Frame The Poetics of Absence in Vera Frenkel’s String Games</div>
      </div>
      <div id="description">
        I found Vera Frenkel’s String Games really interesting for how it uses early technology to show both connection and absence. Frenkel made the gaps feel very real, and it made me think about how even today, digital media can create closeness but still leave something missing. I didn’t feel a strong emotional connection between String Games and Body Missing. While Frenkel explores loss in both, Body Missing felt more like piecing through an archive than experiencing disconnection in the moment.        <br><br>
        <strong>Questions:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Does Frenkel’s idea of absence apply to all digital memories today?</li>

      </div>
      <div id="description">
        I thought Paul Soulellis’s Performing the Feed was really accurate in describing how today's feeds feel like "texture" rather than interruptions. I agree that feeds can be soothing, but they also make it easy for misinformation to blend in unnoticed. I liked how Soulellis pushed us to think about how publishing today is less about moments of meaning and more about endless flow. It made me realize how important it is to be mindful of what we consume and share online.        <br><br>
        <strong>Questions:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Do you think we can ever fully "curate" our feeds to avoid passive consumption?</li>
          <li>How do you think the idea of "texture" changes the way we value or ignore content?</li>

      </div>
      <div id="description">
        I thought Beyond Dark Matter by Neta Bomani and Sabii Borno raised important points about control and technology, especially through the master/slave language still found in computing. I appreciated how the story used Gem’s experience to show how isolating and controlling technology can feel, and why it’s important to imagine new ways of relating to it through community and creativity. While I understood the racial framing the authors used, I felt there could have been more space to explore other perspectives, like class or general feelings of alienation many people face with technology.        <br><br>
        <strong>Questions:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Did the idea of "The Beyond" make you think differently about how we can resist feeling trapped by technology?</li>

        Week 15 - <div id="piece_title">Boris Groys - Art on the Internet</div>
      </div>
      <div id="description">
        I thought Boris Groys’s Art on the Internet made a really strong point about how the internet shifts art from being fictional to nonfictional. I liked how Groys’s idea helped explain why things like TikToks and game shows feel different from traditional forms of art. There are constant reminders of the real world, whether that is through likes, comments, or purchases which break the immersion that makes something feel "artistic." It made me think differently about why short-form content often feels more like "content" than "art," even when it’s creative.        <br><br>
        <strong>Questions:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Do you think short-form videos like TikToks or Reels could ever fully become an art form?</li>
          <li>How do you personally decide whether something feels more like "art" or just "content"?</li>
